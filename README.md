# Python_Project3_File_Compression_and_Encoding_In_Python
 In this section we will learn how to perform file compression in Python to reduce file size. We also learn how to de-compress the compressed data and the methods used for it. We build a GUI based file compression tool using Python & Tkinter and a file compression library.
